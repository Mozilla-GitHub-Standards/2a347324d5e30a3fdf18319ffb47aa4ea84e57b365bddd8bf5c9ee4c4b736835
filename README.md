helpdesk.mozilla.com wp-content - themes and plugins

No custom plugins presently
1 custom theme

Any stock plugins or themes should be pulled from upstream WP.com SVN repos,
not simply copied into here!

Simple solution: add them to .gitignore, and check them out locally on the 
admin node in the right place.
